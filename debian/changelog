    "secboot" option, which had changed when libvirt moved from built-in
    nvram configs to parsing external firmware descriptors. LP: #1864532.
    - Reintroduce OVMF_CODE.ms.fd symlink, but now it points to
      OVMF_CODE.secboot.fd instead of OVMF_CODE.fd, which enforces SMM.
    - Update firmware descriptor JSON files:
      + Update the existing secboot descriptor to use an empty variable
        store. This makes it Secure Boot-capable, but with Secure Boot
        initially disabled. Note that previously it used a store w/ keys
        pre-enrolled, without advertising that feature.
      + Add a new "ms" descriptor which has keys pre-enrolled, has Secure
        Boot enabled, and advertises the "enrolled-keys" feature.
      + Provide more details in "description" fields.
